# Back-end

First steps: in this repository I store my process towards creating a server-side backend for my applications.


## Tech stack

I learnt that there are two mainstream stacks people use: LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) and MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS). I initially wanted to go for a MEAN stack, as this is all coded in Javascript and seems to be more future-proof. However, my hosting provider does not support Node.JS, which is why I went for the LAMP stack instead since I can actually use this on my website.
